# Freezing-Truck
Certain foods or items needs to be stored in constant temperature otherwise the quality of the product can detoriate which can cost huge loss to manufacturing companies. Additionally while carrying expensive items such as containers,imported items, we can use the tracking part alone.

The purpose of this project is to measure temperature and showing location of freezing trucks (example: Ice cream truck, food truck,organ transport) 

Project Scope:
  1. Continuous temperature measurement and send the data to server.
  2. Tracking the location of Truck and show it on maps.
